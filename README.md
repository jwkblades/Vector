Vector
==========

A small Vector class written in C++ (live on a twitch stream) to walk
through design decisions and reasons (as well as functionality) behind a
Vector.

Some portions of the class have been left purposely incomplete for users to
fill in if they so choose.

Twitch?
=======

Yeah, they have a programming section and everything, so I figured I'd lend
some knowledge to programming broadcasts that take the form of a video
tutorial. In the broadcasts I go through what I am creating, why I am making
the decisions I am (and programming the items in a given way) as well as some
of the common pit falls that people just starting out run in to.

If you are interested in viewing a broadcast at some point, feel free to drop
